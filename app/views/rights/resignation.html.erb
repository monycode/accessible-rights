    <h3>Want to know wich rights you have after you resigned?</h3>
    <p>
      According to the Federal Labor Law, all workers are entitled to the following benefits:
       <ul>
        <li>christmas bonus: of at least fifteen days of your salary</li>
        <li>payed vacations.</li>
        <li>vacation bonus: should be at least 25% of your salary for each day of vacations.</li>
        <li>social security.</li>
        <li>salary payment according to the executed work.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to know that even if you resigned you are entitled to a fair settlement.
      The labor law states that if you resign voluntarily, you are entitled to a settlment that
      includes the proportional parts of your christmas bonus, vacations, vacation bonus and worked
      days that have not been paid.
    </p>
    <h3>What can you do if your employer refuse to provide a fair severance payment?</h3>
    <p>
      The law protects you, so there are several resources you got at your disposal to defend your
      rights.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The federal office for the defense of the worker, can
      provide with free legal advice, you can contact them <a href="https://www.gob.mx/profedet">here.</a>
      </li>
      <li>Your local conciliation and arbitration board can help you mediate with your employer
      to arrive to a friendly solution.</li>
      <li>If everything else fails you can sue your former employer and be provided with a free defense attorney.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>
      If you are not sure if your settlement is correct you can use our <a href="calculations/new">calculator </a>
      that will give you the right amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also you can consult our <a href="forums/Resigning">forum </a>and ask our community of law professionals
      or see if someone has had the same question as you.
